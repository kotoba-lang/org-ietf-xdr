  `clojure -M:test` answers for the JVM. Nothing answered for ClojureScript
  until this file existed, and `xdr.core` did not in fact load there at all:
  `get-u64` was written with `+'` and `*'`, which the JVM has and
  ClojureScript does not have under any name. A `.cljc` extension was the
  whole of the claim.

  ## Why the exit code is the point

  `cljs.test/run-tests` prints a summary and returns. A runner that only
  printed would report a red suite with exit 0, and every caller that reads
  an exit code — a shell, a gate — would call that a pass.

  ## Why the suite list is compared with the disk

  `clojure -M:test` finds test namespaces by scanning the test path. A
  ClojureScript runner cannot: the list below is written by hand, so the way
  it breaks is that someone adds `foo_test.cljc` and does not add it here.
  The suite then shrinks and the summary still says no failures.

  The other direction is not the risk — a namespace listed here but absent
  from disk makes nbb throw `No namespace … found` before anything runs,
  which is loud. So `test/` is walked for `*_test.cljc` and the namespaces
  it implies are compared with `suite`, and a scan that could not happen
  reports that rather than reporting clean."
