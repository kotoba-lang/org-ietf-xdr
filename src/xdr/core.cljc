  "XDR — External Data Representation (RFC 4506), schema-driven, portable `.cljc`.

  The codec every ONC RPC protocol is written in: NFS, MOUNT, NLM, and the
  portmapper all describe themselves in the XDR language and then say
  nothing further about bytes, because XDR has already said it.

  ## A schema is data

  Same shape as `protobuf.wire`'s: an ordinary EDN value, reviewable next to
  the RFC it came from rather than hidden in generated output.

      [:struct
       [:status  [:enum]]
       [:handle  [:opaque* 64]]
       [:name    [:string 255]]]

  ## The four rules that are not obvious

  - **Everything is a multiple of four bytes.** Opaque and string data are
    followed by up to three zero bytes. The padding is not optional and it
    is not part of the length: a decoder that forgets to skip it reads the
    next field from the wrong offset, and every field after that is wrong
    too.
  - **There are no optional fields, only optional *data*.** RFC 4506 §4.19
    encodes it as a boolean followed by the value when true. NFS uses it
    everywhere (`post_op_attr`, `post_op_fh3`), which is why `[:optional T]`
    is here rather than being someone's convention.
  - **A union's arms are selected by a discriminant that is itself
    encoded.** The default arm is legal and common; `void` arms are how NFS
    says \"on failure there is nothing else\".
  - **Signed and unsigned differ only in interpretation**, both four bytes
    big-endian. Getting this wrong is invisible until a file is larger than
    2 GiB or a status code has the high bit set.

  ## Bytes

  In and out are platform bytes (`byte[]` on the JVM, `Uint8Array` on
  ClojureScript). Opaque and string payloads stay as platform bytes inside
  decoded values rather than being exploded into integer vectors — an NFS
  READ reply carries up to 64 KiB of file content, and turning that into a
  boxed vector per call is the difference between a filesystem and a
  demonstration."

;; ── a hyper is 64 bits wide, on a host that has no such number ────────────
;;
;; The JVM has `long`, which is exactly the wire's eight bytes, and
;; `clojure.lang.BigInt` for the one unsigned range a long cannot hold
;; (2^63 and above). ClojureScript has doubles: exact only to 2^53, and
;; every bitwise operator truncates to 32 bits first. Neither is a hyper.
;;
;; The one primitive on that side with the right semantics is `BigInt`, and
;; that is what this library already does everywhere a 64-bit value has to
;; survive a wire: `blake2.word` ("a `long` on :clj, a `BigInt` on :cljs"),
;; `kotoba.kir.cljs-i64` ("never a plain cljs number"), and `ipld.value`,
;; which puts one on a wire with `DataView.setBigInt64`.
;;
;; The other approach in this workspace — `io-multiformats` and
;; `dev-protobuf` refuse anything above 2^53 rather than encode it — is
;; right for those two and wrong here, and both say so themselves: they
;; scope the refusal to codecs whose values do not reach 2^53, and both
;; name the big-integer path as the thing you grow when they do. NFS's
;; `fileid3`, `cookie3` and `writeverf3` are full-width `uint64` and the
;; high bit is ordinary in all three. Refusing them on ClojureScript while
;; the JVM decodes them exactly — which the `+'` below already did — is the
;; cross-host disagreement `protobuf.wire` calls worse than either answer.
;;
;; So on ClojureScript a decoded `hyper`/`uhyper` is ALWAYS a `BigInt`,
;; never sometimes one. A codec that returned a plain number below 2^53 and
;; a BigInt above it would work against one NFS server and throw `Cannot
;; mix BigInt and other types` against the next, and which server you had
;; is not a property anyone tests for.
